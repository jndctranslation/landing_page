High quality, accurate translation and localisation of marketing material, such as websites is perhaps one of the most important and vital measures a business must take in order to successfully reach and obtain new customers in foreign markets. In today’s globalised world, where internet rules our lives, both professional and personal, and where over 20% people purchase goods from foreign countries, professional and reliable translation of your marketing material is strategic for the development of your business.

## Here is 5 Things You Need From Professional Translation Services

1. **_Qualified Translators_**

Language translation is a highly specialized field and translators must be experienced and qualified. While many people believe that interpreters and translators can perform the same functions, written translation requires a different expertise and skill set than oral interpretation. Many interpreters are not qualified to provide written translation and vice versa. 

At JNDC Translation, our translators go through specialized training to meet the unique set of skills, knowledge and experience to ensure proficiency in [legal translation](https://www.jndctranslation.com/pages/legal), [financial translation](https://www.jndctranslation.com/pages/financial), [technical translation](https://www.jndctranslation.com/pages/manufacturing_engineering), education and social services content, formatting, etc. JNDC Translation only uses Translators that have Native Fluency in both the Target Language and English. Our translators must have at least 3 years experience in written translation and are also subject-matter experts as professional translation services require extensive knowledge of grammar, context, terminology and multiple meanings in targeted language.

2. _**Human Translation**_

Many companies offer machine translation or a blend of machine and human translation. Human translation offers the highest level of accuracy and should always be used for critical documents and documents presented to the public. Because a qualified linguist understands the idioms and grammar in a written work, he or she is able to use discretion for the most reliable and effective translation. This can also make written material feel more personalized, as [professional translation services](https://www.jndctranslation.com/) offer the best possible interpretation for the subject matter, and not just a literal translation. Many of our customers have a need for highly [technical translation](https://www.jndctranslation.com/pages/manufacturing_engineering), such as medical translation and [legal translation](https://www.jndctranslation.com/pages/legal) and we provide the highest level of accuracy for our customers with 100% human translation services performed by professional translators.

3. _**Quality Control for Translation Projects**_

It’s critical to ensure that all written translations go through a quality control process to ensure accuracy for your project. You don’t want a company that outsources the work and offers no in-house control. The quality control process should include multiple levels of [editing and proofreading](https://www.jndctranslation.com/pages/proofreading_edditing_services). We assign translation projects to specific translators based on their experience and subject-matter expertise. 

In addition to our high standards for our translators at JNDC Translation, all projects are coordinated by a dedicated JNDC Translation project manager and proofread and edited by experts, as well as by publishing experts so our clients get the level of accuracy they need for professional translations.

4. _**Timely and Efficient Translation Services**_

Delivery time standards for human translation services are determined by the project scope – size, content and specific formatting needs. JNDC Translation guarantees timely and efficient written translations. Deadlines for translating materials are determined in the review of the project and stated in a quote to the client for project approval.

When an emergency presents itself, it can be tempting to use machine translation, but the quality of written translation may be diminished by this approach so we never use machine translation in any projects that we undertake. JNDC Translation ensures that our customers have access to professional translation services, which includes emergency and rush services.
